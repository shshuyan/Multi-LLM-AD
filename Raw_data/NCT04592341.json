Reference ROI (whole cerebellum) was represented by weighted average of Cerebellum Ventral,Cerebellum Dorsal (left/right), Cerebellar White Matter.SUVR linearly transformed to standardized Centiloid Scale (CL) using formula CL=175.6xSUVR-174.2.CL ranges from \\<0 to \\>100, anchor points are 0=high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100=amount of global amyloid deposition found in typical AD scan.",
