      "briefSummary": "The reason for this study is to see how safe and effective the study drug donanemab is in participants with early Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAdditional participants will be enrolled to an addendum safety cohort. The participants will be administered open-label donanemab.\n\nTrial participants who were dosed with donanemab in the main study will be enrolled to a 3-year follow up addendum. No study drug will be administered during this follow up.",
      "detailedDescription": "TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 is a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of N3pG antibody (donanemab) in participants with early symptomatic AD (prodromal AD and mild dementia due to AD) with the presence of brain amyloid and tau pathology.\n\nFollowing the double-blind 76-week main study period, a double-blind 78-week long-term extension period is added to further evaluate donanemab efficacy and safety over time. Participants from the addendum safety cohort are not eligible for the extension period.\n\nParticipants previously dosed with donanemab in the main study will be monitored to track re-accumulation of amyloid plaque for 3 years."

Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical brain regions relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan.
