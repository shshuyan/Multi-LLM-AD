      "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, double-blind study that will evaluate 265 mg twice daily (BID) of ALZ-801, an oral tablet, over 78 weeks as a treatment for subjects (50-80 years old) with Early AD who are homozygous for the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein gene (APOE4 homozygous or APOE4/4). The primary efficacy outcome assessment is a measure of cognition (ADAS-cog 13). Additional measures of global and functional impairments will also be assessed. Imaging and soluble biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration will be measured and a sub-study to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is also included."

Instrumental ADL can be described as the activities necessary to function independently in society. These activities include, but are not limited to, cooking, doing finances, and shopping. They are complex everyday tasks, determined by multiple cognitive processes and controlled processing. They can be distinguished from basic ADL, which include basic self-care skills. The A-IADL-W has a score range of 0-100 and is calculated as follows: (sum of all scores / number of questions scored) × 25. For A-IADL-W, higher scores indicates worse functioning or more impairment.",

          "description": "Change from baseline in Bilateral Fornix White Matter Fractional Anisotropy as measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI-MRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a unitless, scalar value that measures the degree of anisotropic (directional) water diffusion within a voxel, ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates perfectly isotropic (equal in all directions) diffusion, while a value of 1 indicates perfectly anisotropic (directional) diffusion. Higher FA value suggests better maintenance of microstructural integrity of a given brain tissue. Positive treatment effects of ALZ-801 on DTI would present as higher FA in the ALZ-801 group compared with the placebo group.",
