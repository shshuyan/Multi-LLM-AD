      "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of gantenerumab versus placebo in participants with early (prodromal to mild) AD. All participants must show evidence of beta-amyloid pathology. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous (SC) injection of gantenerumab or placebo. The primary efficacy assessment will be performed at the end of the double blind period at week 116. Participants will then be offered to enter into an open-label extension (OLE). Participants not willing to go to the OLE will participate in a long term follow-up period for up to 50 weeks after the last gantenerumab dose."

Tau load was measured using SUVR in 4 composite target ROIs: Temporal target region included (both left \\& right)=anterior \\&posterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus, \\&middle \\&inferior temporal gyrus; Medial temporal region excluding hippocampus included (both left \\& right): amygdala, parahippocampus \\& anterior medial \\& lateral temporal lobe; Frontal lobe (both left \\& right) \\& Parietal lobe (both left \\& right). Inferior cerebellar grey matter=reference region for calculating SUVRs for 4 target regions. Tau-PET-mITT analysis set=all participants in ITT analysis set who participated in Tau PET sub-study \\& had at least one Tau PET scan with valid quantitative measurement \\& who did not withdraw from Tau PET substudy before randomization. Overall number analyzed=number of participants with data available for analysis.",

These studies had identical study design \\&enrolled an Early AD population. Tau PET analysis was planned in a subset of participants, to get an optimum sample size for analysis, it was pre-planned to conduct one tau PET substudy for participants willing to consent to the procedure.",
