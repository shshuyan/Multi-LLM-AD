Prespecified severity anchors range from none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 to severe = 3 (the personal care domain omits the 0.5 score). \"Sum of boxes\" scoring methodology sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 that can change in increments of 0.5 or greater. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used to analyze change from baseline in CDR-SB.

Following caregiver interview and systematic patient examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. Prespecified severity anchors range from none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2 to severe = 3 (the personal care domain omits the 0.5 score). \"Sum of boxes\" scoring methodology sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 that can change in increments of 0.5 or greater. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used to analyze change from baseline in CDR-SB. A positive change from baseline indicates clinical decline.",
