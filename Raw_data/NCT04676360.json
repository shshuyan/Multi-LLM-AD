It works by using the antibody portion to enter into the lymphoma cells, and then releasing the drug portion to kill the lymphoma cells.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter phase 2 study of belantamab mafodotin on participants with plasmablastic lymphoma and ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma.The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment, including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\n* This research study involves the study drug belantamab mafodotin.\n* Participants may receive the study treatment until progression or intolerance, and will be followed up to 2 years.\n* It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved belantamab mafodotin as a treatment for any disease.

To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* Belantamab mafodotin is potentially teratogenic. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study intervention. Women must also agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons):\n\n  * ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for \\>1 year\n  * Patients who have been amenorrhoeic for \\<2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation\n  * Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation.

At the discretion of the overall PI, participants with residual toxicities \\> Grade 1 may be considered eligible if in the opinion of the overall PI the residual toxicity is not likely to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants must not have central nervous system involvement by lymphoma, as belantamab mafodotin is not known to penetrate the CNS.\n* Participant must not use contact lenses while participating in this study.\n* Participant must not be simultaneously enrolled in any interventional clinical trial.\n* Participant must not have used an investigational drug or approved systemic lymphoma therapy within 14 days or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, preceding the first dose of study drug.

Participants must not have any serious and/or pre-existing medical or other condition (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with participant's safety in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating are excluded from this study because belantamab mafodotin can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with belantamab mafodotin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with belantamab mafodotin.\n* Participant must not have presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. Patients with presence of HBsAg, but demonstrate both HBSag and HBV PCR negativity will be eligible for the study.
