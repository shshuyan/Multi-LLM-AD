The A4 study will test an anti-amyloid investigational drug in older individuals who do not yet show symptoms of Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment or dementia with the aim of slowing memory and cognitive decline. The A4 study will also test whether anti-amyloid treatment can delay the progression of AD related brain injury on imaging and other biomarkers."

Informants are additionally asked to evaluate whether activities were completed less often, required more time to complete, and if any errors were made performing the task. High-level function items are rated as \"yes\" or \"no\". The scores range from 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating less impairment.
