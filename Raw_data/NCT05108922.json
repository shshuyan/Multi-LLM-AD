Amyloid PET scan assesses cerebral amyloid load using florbetapir tracer which is standardized into Centiloids for evaluation of AD. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. Centiloid values on Centiloid scale is based on mean composite Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes using whole cerebellum as reference region. SUVR is ratio of tracer uptake in each of cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes relative to cerebellum.

Amyloid PET scan assesses cerebral amyloid load using florbetapir tracer which is standardized into Centiloids for evaluation of AD. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques. Centiloid values on Centiloid scale is based on mean composite Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes using whole cerebellum as reference region. SUVR is ratio of tracer uptake in each of cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes relative to cerebellum. Complete brain amyloid plaque clearance is a binary outcome and is defined as a Centiloid value \\<24.1 from the florbetapir F18 PET scan.",

Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region.

The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan.
